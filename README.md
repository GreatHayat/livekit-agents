# 🚀 Exploring LiveKit Agents

This repository documents my learning journey with **LiveKit Agents** — exploring how voice and AI workflows come together.
So far, I’ve explored:

* `Agent`
* `AgentSession`
* `Plugins`
* `Workflows`
* `Function Calling`
* `Passing & Saving Data to State`

I’ll continue pushing my experiments and progress here as I go deeper into the LiveKit ecosystem.
